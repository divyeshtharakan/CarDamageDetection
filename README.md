Overview
Car accidents lead to significant losses due to delays and inaccuracies in processing insurance claims. This project leverages deep learning to detect and classify different types of car damage (e.g., scratches, dents, glass breakage) to streamline and improve the claim process.

Problem Statement
The aim is to create an automated model that can:

Detect damage in vehicle images.
Classify the type of damage accurately.
Reduce the complexity and processing time for insurance claims.
Project Purpose
Automate Damage Detection: Use deep learning to identify and classify car damages.
Improve Efficiency: Speed up the insurance claim process by providing rapid and accurate damage assessments.
Leverage Advanced Techniques: Utilize state-of-the-art methods such as Mask R-CNN and transfer learning to improve model performance.
Dataset
Data Collection: Images of damaged vehicles were manually collected from the internet.
Categories: Images are categorized into scratches, dents, and glass breakage.
Data Augmentation: Due to the limited number of images, data augmentation techniques were applied to increase dataset size.
Annotation: VGG Image Annotator was used to annotate images; the annotations are stored in JSON format.
Methodology
Image Collection and Annotation:
Manually collect images of damaged vehicles.
Annotate the images using VGG Image Annotator.
Data Augmentation:
Augment the dataset to increase the number of training samples.
Model Training:
Use Mask R-CNN for object detection and segmentation.
Employ transfer learning to leverage pre-trained models (e.g., VGG-16, ResNet) for feature extraction.
Experiment with different approaches such as training from scratch, fine-tuning, and ensemble learning.
Evaluation:
Compare the accuracy and efficiency of various methodologies.
Use performance metrics to validate the effectiveness of the system.
Tools and Libraries
Deep Learning Frameworks: TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch (depending on implementation).
Annotation Tool: VGG Image Annotator.
Other Libraries: OpenCV, NumPy, and Mask R-CNN related libraries.
Coding Environment: Python 3.x.
Results and Conclusion
The experiments indicate that transfer learning combined with ensemble techniques significantly improves detection accuracy.
Mask R-CNN demonstrated strong performance in detecting and classifying damage regions.
The project highlights the effectiveness of deep learning for automating damage assessment, paving the way for faster and more reliable insurance processing.
